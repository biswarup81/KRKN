<p>POVERTY AND MICROFINANCE: INTERROGATING SELF-HELP GROUPS EXPERIENCE FROM PURI DISTRICT, OF ORISSA </p>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h4>Focal theme and Findings of this Project</h4>
<p>Development interventions are of many types and are implemented through different ways. Group approach has already been established as one of the potential tools. The success of group approach in rural micro-finance through SHG (Self Help Group) among the poor has inspired the tendency to look at all networking as essential and desirable in rural community development. This research aims to explore the impact of socio-economic condition on accumulation of social capital through participation in SHGs and pre-membership of SHGs under some Block of Puri District in Orissa and this research also justified the two way relationship between accumulation of social capital and effectiveness of SHGs in empowering its members economically & socially in this region. The study shows that there is a positive relationship between the years of association of the SHG member and the social empowerment (case of some parameter) which is created with the help of social capital. Micro finance organizations as well as government regulatory bodies both play supportive and innovative approach which are helping the existing financial condition but some time, in various cases regulatory bodies can not play supportive approach for development and poverty eradication. </p>

<h4>Title of this Project</h4>
<p>POVERTY ALLEVIATION THROUGH MICROFINANCE IN SOME PARTS OF BURDWAN DISTRICT, WEST BENGAL</p>
<h4>Focal theme of this Project</h4>
<p>Microfinance through SHG(Self Help Group) has demonstrated its potential for delivering a full range of commercial financial services to micro-entrepreneurs and poor families that are conventionally considered ‘‘unbankable’’ due to high transaction costs, perceived risks and low margins. Therefore, different Government schemes (through microfinance) designed for poverty alleviation among poor’s have been successful somewhere, but do not take into account the diversities of situation at the <strong>grass-root</strong> level (Drawing from research in interior rural areas of some parts of Burdwan District of West Bengal). This study aims at the viability of micro-finance and group approach as poverty alleviating strategies.</p>

<h4>Title of this Project</h4>
<p>WASTELAND AND STRATEGY FOR ITS MANAGEMENT THROUGH SOME PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF DEOGHAR DISTRICT, JHARKHAND.</p>


<h4>Findings of this Project</h4>
<p>The study attempts to analyse in detail all general and specific components, essential for wasteland classification and evolution, which can play an important role in making any conservation and reclamation programme by providing necessary informations that can also make these wastelands productive than now. It was observed that waste land increased to 59.60% of the total areas. In some places waste land increased as much as 10% to 15% with in 20% area of the total geographical areas due to mismanagement and lack of awareness.</p>

<p>This land can be converted into pasture land for farming of live stocks, fuel wood production and dry land farming. Although agricultural income is dominating, other employment generation programme are also needed for sustainable development with the help of wasteland management.</p>

<h4>This region needs special attention like :</h4>
<p>Agricultural loan provided to the farmers should be adequate and timely in the form of K C C, but proper planning and awareness of local people are equally very essential for plot to plot wasteland management. </p>

<h4>Title of this Project</h4>
<p>AGRICULTURAL BACKWARDNESS AND STRATEGY FOR ITS REMOVAL THROUGH SOCIAL MOBILIZATION IN THE MADHUPUR SUBDIVIAION, JHARKHAND.</p>

<h4>Findings of this Project</h4>
<p>The level of agricultural development is not uniform through out this area. The numeric value of all the indicators is very low which indicates low agricultural development. So, this region needs special attention. Overall development took place in some specific cases, where the NGOs worked sincerely.</p>

<h4>The rate of development could be accelerated through providing some facilities like :</h4>
<p>Taping local resources (institutions, private and public sectors etc). Voluntary agencies and the government at local level should assist the poor farmers by arranging demonstration of improved technical methods and providing appropriate agricultural technology for reclamation.<br>
Wider publicity campaigns should be lunched at central, state and local government levels.<p>
